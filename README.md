# FS-TMB-ICI
An analysis of the relationships between frameshift mutations, tumor mutational burden, and immune checkpoint inhibitors

## T-Tests
I performed independent t-tests to determine the significance between frameshift mutations, tumor burden, treatment burden and survival time.

## Chi-Square
I performed chi-squared contingency tests to determine the significance between treatment type, tumor mutation, and treatment response rate. I also checked for a correlation between background information and genomic status. 

## ANOVA 
I performed one-way ANOVA tests to determine the significance between age, treatment count, and ECOG and genomic classification.
